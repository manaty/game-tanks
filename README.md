# Tanks · Ricochets

Play Tanks · Ricochets together on a shared screen, using phones as controllers. 2–5 players.

An independent, open-source Manaty game for 2–5 players. English, French and Tagalog. No Retro Museum installation or account is required to run it.

## Play on your own server

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm start
```

Open [localhost:4311](http://localhost:4311), click **Play now**, and scan the displayed QR with each phone. On Wi-Fi, set `PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the computer's reachable address, such as `http://192.168.1.10:4311`. In production use its HTTPS origin. `PORT` and `DATA_DIR` are configurable.

The room organiser can start, pause and end the game; players can replay. Profiles, cropped avatars and phone language are saved in the browser. Late arrivals play in the next match. Game logic is authoritative on the server, and private roles/cards never appear on the shared display.

## Development

```sh
npm run build
npm test
```

The runtime and room transport come from the [Retro Museum SDK](https://github.com/manaty/retro-museum-sdk). This repository owns its engine, interface, compiled package and tests.
